      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Advanced StatisticsTransformations of Random VariablesLet me set the example;You have two independant random variables $X$ with pdf $f_{X}(x)$ and $Y$ with pdf $f_{Y}(y)$.You will have a new random variable $Z$, where $Z=X-Y$, and say we want to calculate the marginal pdf of $Z$.First we need to make a new joint pdf including Z, to avoid cluterization of the same random variables, lets first let give $X$ a different name, i.e. $X=W$.Now we saw that we have $Z=X-Y$, but now its $Z=W-Y$.We want to know our variable $Y$, so we re-arrange the above to get $Y=W-Z$. Now, we use something called a Jacobian, and we will use its determinant to transform from $(x,y)$ to $(w,z)$, and then we can get the marginal pdf of $Z$.So the jacobian is:$$|J|=|\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(w,z)}|=\begin{vmatrix}\frac{\partial x}{\partial w} &amp; \frac{\partial y}{\partial w} \\\\frac{\partial x}{\partial z} &amp; \frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\end{vmatrix}$$We can then do the following:$$f_{Z,W}=f_{X,Y}(w,w-Z)|J|$$$$=f_{X}(w)f_{Y}(w-z) \cdot |J|$$And then finally, to find the marginal pdf of $Z$, we intergrate out w from the joint pdf:$$f_{Z}(z)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{X}(w)f_{Y}(w-z)dw$$]]></content>
